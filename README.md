 Obtaining permission from the user and recording data.

 
With this application, when art lovers come across a work of art, they will have an application where they can quickly note its photo, name, artist, date.
They will be able to grant access to their galleries themselves. They will be able to keep all data safe until the app is deleted.
The photos will be resized with Java, so the application will not need a very large storage space.
